## üéØ Project Overview

### What It Does
- **üì∏ Wardrobe Digitization**: Upload clothing photos, get automatic AI categorization
- **üõí Shopping Analysis**: Paste shopping URLs, extract product info and compatibility scores  
- **‚ú® Outfit Generation**: Create realistic outfit visualizations using AI image generation

### AI Models Used
- **Fashion-CLIP**: Fashion-specific vision-language model for categorization and compatibility
- **FLUX Outfit Generator**: Text-to-image model specialized for fashion/clothing
- **Web Scraping**: Custom scraper for extracting product data from shopping sites

---

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- MacBook Pro M4 Pro (or similar with 48GB+ RAM)
- Python 3.9+
- **uv** (fast Python package manager) - Install: `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`
- Internet connection for model downloads

> **Why uv?** 10-100x faster than pip, better dependency resolution, modern Python tooling

### Installation

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd fashion_assist_poc

# Initialize project with uv (faster than pip/venv)
uv init --python 3.11

# Install dependencies
uv add streamlit torch torchvision transformers diffusers accelerate
uv add open-clip-torch Pillow opencv-python numpy
uv add requests beautifulsoup4 selenium scikit-learn pandas

# Create directory structure
mkdir -p data/{wardrobe,scraped,generated}

# Run application
uv run streamlit run app.py
```

### First Run
1. Open `http://localhost:8501` in your browser
2. Upload 2-3 clothing photos in "Upload Wardrobe" tab
3. Paste a shopping URL in "Analyze Shopping" tab
4. Generate outfit in "Generate Outfit" tab
