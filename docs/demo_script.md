**Actions:**
1. Click "Generate Outfit" tab
2. Select shopping item + 1-2 wardrobe items
3. Choose style (e.g., "business casual")
4. Click "Generate Outfit"
5. Show AI-generated outfit image

**Highlight:**
- FLUX model creates realistic outfit visualization
- Combines new purchase with existing clothes
- Multiple style options available
- Helps visualize before buying

**Expected Output:**
- Generated image showing complete outfit
- Professional, realistic styling
- Cohesive color coordination

### Closing (30 seconds)
**Script:**
> "In just one week, I've created a working AI system that combines computer vision, web scraping, and generative AI to solve a real shopping problem. This demonstrates how quickly we can build practical AI applications today."

**Show:** Generated outfit gallery

## ðŸ›  Pre-Demo Setup Checklist

### Technical Preparation
- [ ] App running locally on `localhost:8501`
- [ ] All models downloaded and tested
- [ ] Sample wardrobe images prepared (4-5 items)
- [ ] Test shopping URLs identified and verified
- [ ] Generated examples pre-created as backup
- [ ] Internet connection stable

### Sample Data Preparation

#### Wardrobe Images (data/wardrobe/)
```
shirt_blue.jpg      # Blue button-down shirt
pants_black.jpg     # Black dress pants
dress_red.jpg       # Red cocktail dress
shoes_white.jpg     # White sneakers
jacket_navy.jpg     # Navy blazer
```

#### Test Shopping URLs
```
H&M: https://www2.hm.com/en_us/productpage.0570006001.html
Zara: https://www.zara.com/us/en/basic-t-shirt-p00706460.html
Target: https://www.target.com/p/women-s-short-sleeve-t-shirt/
```

### Backup Materials
- [ ] Screenshots of working features
- [ ] Pre-generated outfit examples
- [ ] Error handling demonstrations
- [ ] Performance metrics noted

## ðŸ’¡ Key Technical Points to Mention

### Model Integration Architecture
> "This system integrates three different AI models: Fashion-CLIP for understanding fashion semantics, a web scraper for data extraction, and FLUX for image generation."

### Performance on Apple Silicon
> "Running entirely locally on M4 Pro with 48GB unified memory - the outfit generation takes about 30-45 seconds, which is remarkably fast for this quality."

### Zero-Shot Learning
> "The Fashion-CLIP model wasn't specifically trained on my wardrobe - it uses zero-shot learning to categorize any clothing items."

### Real-World Applicability
> "This addresses the real problem of online shopping uncertainty - 'will this look good with what I already own?'"

## ðŸŽ¯ Q&A Preparation

### Expected Questions & Answers

**Q: How accurate is the AI categorization?**
A: "Fashion-CLIP achieves about 80-85% accuracy on fashion categories. For this POC, I focused on major categories, but it can be fine-tuned for more specific classifications."

**Q: Can it handle different clothing styles/cultures?**
A: "Fashion-CLIP was trained on diverse international fashion data, so it recognizes many global styles. The system could be extended with more specific cultural datasets."

**Q: What about different body types?**
A: "This POC focuses on clothing compatibility, but the generated outfits could be conditioned on body measurements for more personalized results."

**Q: How does it handle seasonal recommendations?**
A: "The current version doesn't include seasonal logic, but the text prompts could easily incorporate weather and season context."

**Q: What shopping sites does it work with?**
A: "I've tested with H&M, Zara, and Target. The scraper uses generic HTML patterns, so it works with most e-commerce sites with some customization."

**Q: Could this scale to multiple users?**
A: "Absolutely. The current version uses local storage, but it could easily be deployed with a database backend and cloud model hosting."
